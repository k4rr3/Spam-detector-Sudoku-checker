# Spam-detector-Sudoku-checker
This is our second project developed in C++ where we develop a basic spam detector and a sudoku checker.
SPAM DETECTOR
This program reads a .txt file where there are some keywords (known as spam words) and a text. If the spam words are in the text, the program is able to detect
them. Then the program decides if the text is spam with the detections of the spam words, and if the spam words are detected two or more times in the text and the 
total percentage of spam words is higher than 50% then the text is considered as spam. The number of repetitions and the percentage of spam is shown when the 
program is executed.
