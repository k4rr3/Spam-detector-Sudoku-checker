  Sir/madam

This mail may come to you as a suprise base on the fact that,we have not met.I got your contact from a directory in search for a reliable personality that could understand our situation  to help us.
I am a zimbabwean citizen presently taking refugee in GHANA.Due to crises in my country coupled  with the assisanation of  my late father who was killed by  BY PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE war veteran association who are calling for the white collection of farm land from all white settlers which is wrong.
My father due to his stand over these issues fell out with the ruling party of PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE.Now my mother and I and my kid sister had to flee from our country to find refuge here in GHANA.  Before the death of my father he was a major dealer of  Diamond and Merchandise.He secretly moved these funds acquired from various sales in a trunk-box and deposited it in a security deposit company in Ghana.But at the time of deposit he told the security company that it is family valuables that are contained in the box. The total amount contained in the box is $18 .7M US.

we have all documents with us here in the camp.

We need a trust worthy and experience person that will help us to invest this money in your country  and take us as one family  and will also buy a house for us over there where we can live safely.We are prepared to give you 20% of the money for that assistance.
We are expecting to hear from you.
waiting you for your anticipated cooperation.
